  stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu updated - rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15) (from rustc 1.81.0 (eeb90cda1 2024-09-04))


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish

  stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu unchanged - rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)
